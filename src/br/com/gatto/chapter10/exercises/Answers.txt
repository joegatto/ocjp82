1- B, F. The Driver, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet interfaces are part of the JDK, making choices A and E incorrect. The concrete DriverManager class is also part of the JDK, making choices C and D incorrect. Choices B and F are correct since the implementation of these interfaces is part of the database-specific driver JAR file. 
2- B, C. A JDBC URL has three parts. The first part is the string jdbc, making choice C correct. The second part is the vendor/product name. The third part is database specific, but it includes a database name, making choice B correct as well. The location, such as IP address and port, is optional. 
3- A. A JDBC URL has three main parts separated by single colons, making choices B, C, E, and F incorrect. The first part is always jdbc. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Notice that you can get this right even if you’ve never heard of the Sybase database before. 
4- E. Starting with JDBC 4.0, driver implementations were required to provide the name of the class implementing Driver in a file named java.sql.Driver in the directory META-INF/service. 
5- C. A Connection is created using a static method on DriverManager. It does not use a constructor. Therefore, choice C is correct. If the Connection was created properly, the answer would be choice B. 
6- B, E. Class.forName() was used with old JDBC drivers to load the driver. It is not needed in JDBC 4.0, making choice A incorrect. If it is called, it throws a ClassNotFoundException. By contrast, DriverManager.getConnection() throws a SQLException when the driver cannot be found. Therefore, choices B and E are correct. 
7- C, E, F. The first parameter is the ResultSet type. The second parameter is the ResultSet concurrency mode. Choices A and B are incorrect because they represent the second parameter. Choice D is incorrect because it is not a constant in JDBC. Choices C, E, and F are correct. 
8- E. When a Statement is requested with an unsupported mode, the JDBC driver will downgrade the request to one that is supported. Therefore, choice E is correct. No exception is thrown. Furthermore, choices B and D are incorrect because exceptions with those names do not exist. 
9- B. The first line has a return type of boolean because any type of SQL statement can be run, making it an execute() call. The second line returns the number of modified rows, making it an executeUpdate() call. The third line returns the results of a query, making it an executeQuery() call. 
10- C. This code works as expected. It updates each of the five rows in the table and returns the number of rows updated. Therefore, choice C is correct. 
11- D. JDBC code throws a SQLException, which is a checked exception. The code does not handle or declare this exception, and therefore it doesn’t compile. If the exception were handled or declared, the answer would be choice C. 
12- D. JDBC resources should be closed in the reverse order from that in which they were opened. The order for opening is Connection, Statement, and ResultSet. The order for closing is ResultSet, Statement, and Connection. 
13- D. A Statement automatically closes the open ResultSet when another SQL statement is run. This means that rs is no longer open by the println, and a SQLException is thrown because the ResultSet is closed. 
14- B, F. In a ResultSet, columns are indexed starting with 1, not 0. Therefore, choices A, C, and E are incorrect. There are methods to get the column as a String or Object. However, choice D is incorrect because an Object cannot be assigned to a String without a cast. 
15- F. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not JDBC methods. Choice A is incorrect because it outputs just the month, date, and year. Choice E is incorrect because it outputs just the hours, minutes, and seconds.
16- E. By default, a Statement is not scrollable. The first call to previous() throws a SQLException because the ResultSet type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY. 
17- C, D. Choices B and E are incorrect because those methods don’t exist. Choices A and F are incorrect because these methods return a boolean. Choices C and D are correct. 
18- A. The call to absolute(0) moves the cursor to a location immediately before the results, and then next() goes to the first row, so the answer is choice A. 
19- C. The first println outputs false because the cursor is immediately before the result. The second println outputs true because the cursor is pointing to the fifth row. The third println outputs true because the cursor is pointing to the fourth row. The fourth println outputs true because the cursor is pointing to the second row. The fifth println outputs false because the cursor is located before the beginning of the result. 
20- F. The first and last println statements do not compile. The beforeFirst() and afterLast() methods have a void return type. Therefore, the code does not compile and choice F is correct.
