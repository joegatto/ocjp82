/**
 * Exercise 8 
 * Explanation: G. The code compiles and runs without issue, so C, D,
 * E, F, and H are incorrect. There are two important things to notice: first,
 * synchronizing on the first output doesnâ€™t actually impact the results of
 * the code. Second, sorting on a parallel stream does not mean that findAny()
 * will return the first record. The findAny() method will return the value from
 * the first thread that retrieves a record. Therefore, the output is not
 * guaranteed for either serial or parallel stream. Since the results cannot be
 * predicted ahead of time, G is the correct answer.
