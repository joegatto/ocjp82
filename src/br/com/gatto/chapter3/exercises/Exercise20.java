/**
 * Exercise 20 
 * Explanation: E. This question looks like it is about
 * generics, but itâ€™s not. It is trying to see if you noticed that Map does
 * not have a contains() method. It has containsKey() and containsValue()
 * instead. If containsKey() was called, the answer would be false because the
 * 123 in the list is an Integer rather than a String.
