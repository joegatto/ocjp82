/**
 * Exercise 18
 * Explanation: D. The terminal operation is count(). Since there is
 * a terminal operation, the intermediate operations run. The peek() operation
 * comes before the filter, so both numbers are printed. The count happens to be
 * 1 since the other number is filtered. However, the result of the stream
 * pipeline isnâ€™t stored in a variable, and that result is ignored.
