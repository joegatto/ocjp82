/**
 * Exercise 8 
 * Explanation: C, F. A and B are both incorrect as interfaces can
 * extend other interfaces, although not classes. C is correct since a class may
 * implement multiple interfaces. D is incorrect as interfaces have static and
 * default methods, as well as static final variables. E is incorrect as
 * interfaces are assumed to be abstract, and abstract and final can never be
 * used together. F is correct as interface methods and variables are each
 * assumed public.
