 * Exercise 18 
 * Explanation: B, D, E. Console defines two output methods,
 * format() and printf(), that are identical in function, so B and D are
 * correct. A, C, and F are each incorrect, because there is no such method with
 * that name defined in the Console class. You can also use the writer() method
 * to gain access to the Consoleâ€™s PrintWriter object, so E is correct.
